# High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) Conformance Files
This repository contains file candidates for High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) conformance testing. The files are generated using the HEIF source code available **[here](https://github.com/nokiatech/heif)**

The descriptions of the bitstreams and the files can be found in **[conformance_file_descriptions.xlsx](https://github.com/nokiatech/heif_conformance/blob/master/conformance_file_descriptions.xlsx)** file.

## Contents of the Repository:
This repository contains the following directories:
* \bitstreams: Various HEVC encoded bitstreams to be used in the conformance files
* \configurations: Configuration files which were used to generate the HEIF conformance files.
* \conformance_files: HEIF conformance files
